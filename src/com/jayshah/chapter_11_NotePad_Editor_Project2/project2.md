IDE : Netbeans
- right click on project
- clean and build : it will generate/create .jar file

- in the same class create main method.
- then call `new Notepad()` method constructor from main method.
  - right click on project
  - then click on Export
  - then select Java 
  - then select runnable jar file (not jar file option)
  - select destination path
  - select project
  - select ok/finish
