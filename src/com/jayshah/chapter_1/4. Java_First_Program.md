### Steps to prepare Java First Program :-
1. Download & Install Java Softwares
   (JDK, Editor, IDE's)
2. Create Java First Program
   2.1 Java Naming Conventions
   2.2 Structure of Java Program
   2.3 Java Program Explanation
3. Compile & Run Java Program

### Java Naming Conventions :-
   - Java is case sensitive language which means that declaring upper case and lower case name are different (int a=10; int A=10;)
   - How to declare names :-

```java

class/interface name : 
                        My
                        MyJava
                        MyJavaDemo

method name:
            my() { ... }
            myJava() { .. }
            myJavaDemo() { .. }

variable name:
            
    by programmer: 
            my
            my_java
            my_java_demo
    by JAVA default: Predefine Variable by Java : 
            ALL are declare in capital by default
            MY, MY_DEMO, MY_JAVA_DEMO

package name:
            my, myjava, myjavademo

```
   
### Structure Of Java Program :-
   - There are 5 main sections in a java program :
     1. Documentation Section
     2. Package Statement
     3. Import Statement
     4. Interface/Class Section
        - Variables & Methods
     5. Main Class Section
        - main method

1. Documentation Section
   - It contains the basic information about java program e.g. author's name, date of creation, version, program name, company name, client name, description etc
   - This part is OPTIONAL
   - To create documentation section we use comments
   - There are 3 types of comments :-
     1. Single Line Comment (//)
     2. Multi-Line Comment (/* ----- */)
     3. Documentation Comment  (/** - * - * -  * - * - */)
   - To provide description or metadata of the program Java introduced new feature in JDK 1.5 version i.e. "Annotation" (@---)
   - If we use comments for documentation section then at compilation phase these comments will be removed by the compiler which cannot be read further, so to resolve this problem java introduced annotation which cannot be removed at compilation or runtime.
   - If you want to provide documentation section in html form, then we can use following command in CMD :-
     - javadoc FileName.java
     - e.g. javadoc EmployeeDetails.java
   - javap -version (to get JDK version)
   - javap packagename.ClassName (to get the class details) 
     - e.g.  javap java.util.Scanner
     - e.g.  javap -v java.util.Scanner
