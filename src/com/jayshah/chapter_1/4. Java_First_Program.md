### Steps to prepare Java First Program :-
1. Download & Install Java Softwares
   (JDK, Editor, IDE's)
2. Create Java First Program
   2.1 Java Naming Conventions
   2.2 Structure of Java Program
   2.3 Java Program Explanation
3. Compile & Run Java Program

### Java Naming Conventions :-
   - Java is case sensitive language which means that declaring upper case and lower case name are different (int a=10; int A=10;)
   - How to declare names :-

```java

class/interface name : 
                        My
                        MyJava
                        MyJavaDemo

method name:
            my() { ... }
            myJava() { .. }
            myJavaDemo() { .. }

variable name:
            
    by programmer: 
            my
            my_java
            my_java_demo
    by JAVA default: Predefine Variable by Java : 
            ALL are declare in capital by default
            MY, MY_DEMO, MY_JAVA_DEMO

package name:
            my, myjava, myjavademo

```
   
### Structure Of Java Program :-
   - There are 5 main sections in a java program :
     1. Documentation Section
     2. Package Statement
     3. Import Statement
     4. Interface/Class Section
        - Variables & Methods
     5. Main Class Section
        - main method

1. Documentation Section
   - It contains the basic information about java program e.g. author's name, date of creation, version, program name, company name, client name, description etc
   - This part is OPTIONAL
   - To create documentation section we use comments
   - There are 3 types of comments :-
     1. Single Line Comment (//)
     2. Multi-Line Comment (/* ----- */)
     3. Documentation Comment  (/** - * - * -  * - * - */)
   - To provide description or metadata of the program Java introduced new feature in JDK 1.5 version i.e. "Annotation" (@---)
   - If we use comments for documentation section then at compilation phase these comments will be removed by the compiler which cannot be read further, so to resolve this problem java introduced annotation which cannot be removed at compilation or runtime.
   - If you want to provide documentation section in html form, then we can use following command in CMD :-
     - javadoc FileName.java
     - e.g. javadoc EmployeeDetails.java
   - javap -version (to get JDK version)
   - javap packagename.ClassName (to get the class details) 
     - e.g.  javap java.util.Scanner
     - e.g.  javap -v java.util.Scanner

2. Package Statement
   - It is a group of similar type of classes or interfaces or packages
   - Advantage of package :
     1. It prevents naming conflicts of classes or interfaces
     2. Easy to maintain
     3. Accessibility to classes or interfaces can be controlled (Security)
     4. Reusability
   - Types of packages :
     1. Predefined Package (which are already created by java for eg. lang, awt, swing, util, sql etc)
     2. User Defined Package (which are created by the developer)
   - Syntax : package package_name;
     - Example :
          ```
       package com.school;
          class Employee
          {
       
          }
       ```
   - Conditions for package :
     1. Package statement should be only one in the single java file
     2. Package statement should be the first statement in java file
   - Java provides one facility for naming convention for package that is we can create package on the same name of our domain name but in reverse order. 
     - e.g. `com.jayshah.usacity.techdept`
     - e.g. `com.jayshah.usacity.managingdept`
   - This is OPTIONAL but you should always put all the classes or interfaces in any one package
          
3. Import Statement :-
   - Import statements is used to make available the classes or interfaces which we are going to use in present java file
   - Syntax :
     1. `import packagename.subpackagename.ClassName;`
     2. `import packagename.*;`
   - if we use `import packagename.*;` only classes or interfaces will be imported, not the subpackage.
   - If we do not want to use import statement then we can directly write the `packagename.ClassName` to use that class.
   - This is OPTIONAL to use but mainly we use it in major level projects.
   - This line is written after the package line.
   - java.lang package is the only package which is imported by default
        
4. Interface/Class Section : - Variables & Methods
   - In this section we create classes or interfaces which contains variables, methods, constructors, blocks etc.
5. Main Class Section - main method :
   - In every project or java file there should be one main class which should contain main() method from which the execution of the program will start.
   - Syntax :
   ```
   class Test
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
      }
   }
   ```

#### Java Program Explanation :-
```   
   class Test
   {
        public static void main(Stirng[] args)
        {
            System.out.println("Kem Cho?");
        }
   }
```

```
class   => keyword
Test    => user define class name
{       => class body start
public  => keyword (access modifier)
static  => keyword
void    => keyword (return type keyword)
main    => method
String  => predefined class name (package: java.lang)
[]      => denote to Array
args    => user defined variable name
{       => main method body start
System  => predefined class name (package: java.lang)
out     => predefined static reference variable name of PrintStream class present in System class

   |         }                   |                              |
   |     }                       |   }                          |
   |_____________________________|______________________________|     
   
println => predefined method of PrintStream class 
("Kem Cho?") => data to be printed
}       => main method body end
}       => class body end
```
