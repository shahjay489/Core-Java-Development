## Encapsulation in Java

### Encapsulation :-
- Encapsulation is the process by which variables and methods are wrapped or bind into a single unit.
- Encapsulation is technically hiding the data from other classes and these data can be accessed only through the member functions of its own class. (Data hiding is the part of the encapsulation)
- Examples:
  - Real world example : capsule, mobile
  - Technically every java class is an example of encapsulation
  - Main example of encapsulation in java is "JavaBean" classes
- Encapsulation is achieved by declaring variables as private and public getter and setter methods
- For example :
    ```java
    class Employee
    {
        private int salary;
        public void setSalary(int salary)
        {
           this.salary=salary;
        }
        public int getSalary()
        {
           return salary;
        }
    }
    ```
- In IDE's (eclipse and netbeans) getter and setter methods can be generated directly, so it's very easy to generate encapsulation in IDE's. Also, we can use Lombok.
- Encapsulation = data hiding + abstraction

- Advantages of encapsulation :-
1. Data Hiding
2. Increase flexibility
3. Reusability
4. Testing code is easy
 
### Note: 
- In Encapsulation, we are doing data hiding using private getter and setter. 
- In Abstraction, we are also doing data hiding. When we make the abstract method that we are not implementing functionality.
- Difference? in Abstraction, we hide implementation adn in Encapsulation, we hide data.

#### JavaBean Class :-
- JavaBean class is used to encapsulate the data into single object.
- Rules for JavaBean class :-
  1. Must implement Serializable interface.
  2. Class must contain public no-argument constructor.
  3. Class must have all private variables.
  4. Class must contain public getter and setter methods.
   
#### Tightly Encapsulated Class :-
- A class is tightly encapsulated class if and only if it have all the variables as private

#### Interview Questions :-
1. What is difference between Abstraction & Encapsulation
   - point-1: 
     - Abstraction : It hides the implementation (details).
     - Encapsulation : It hides the data (information).
   - point-2:
     - Abstraction : It is achieved by "abstract class" and "interface".
     - Encapsulation : It is achieved by using "JavaBean" class.
   - point-3: 
     - Abstraction : In case of abstraction we have to use "abstract" keyword.
     - Encapsulation : In case of encapsulation we have to use access modifiers (private & public).
   - point-4: 
     - Abstraction : It resolves the issue at design level.
     - Encapsulation : It resolves the issue at implementation level.

2. Which are 6 main pillars in OOP's?
- there are total 6 pillars,
   1. Classes
   2. Objects & Methods
   3. Inheritance
   4. Polymorphism
   5. Abstraction
   6. Encapsulation
   
```java
// Encapsulation = data hiding + abstraction

// simple bean class we will create and use it.
// for proper bean class, first condition is
// we need to do implement Serializable interface 

// Tightly Encapsulated Class - all variables are private
class Account           // simple java bean class we've made
{
  // kind of data hiding concept
  private int amount;
  private String accno;

  // kind of abstraction concept
  public void setAmount(int amount) {
    this.amount = amount;
  }

  public int getAmount() {
    return amount;
  }

  public void setAccno(String accno) {
    this.accno = accno;
  }

  public String getAccno() {
    return accno;
  }
}

class BankFunctions {
  void deposit(Account acc, int dptamt) {
    int total = acc.getAmount() + dptamt;
    acc.setAmount(total);
  }

  void withdraw(Account acc, int wthamt) {
    int total = acc.getAmount() - wthamt;
    acc.setAmount(total);
  }
}

class AccountMain               // main class
{

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Account ob1 = new Account();      //  creating object of the Account class
    ob1.setAccno("11111");          // set account number
    ob1.setAmount(10000);           // set amount

    BankFunctions bf = new BankFunctions();
    bf.deposit(ob1, 5000);
    bf.withdraw(ob1, 3000);

    System.out.println("Full Details : " + ob1.getAccno() + " : " + ob1.getAmount());         // getting values by using getter
  }
}
```
```java
// Tightly Encapsulated Class? -> YES
class A
{
    private int a;
    private String str1;
}

// Tightly Encapsulated Class? -> NO
class B extends A
{
  int a;
}

// Tightly Encapsulated Class? -> YES
class c extends A
{
  private int no1;
}
```

```java
// Tightly Encapsulated Class? -> NO
class A
{
    private int a;
    String str1;
}

// Tightly Encapsulated Class? -> NO
class B extends A
{
  int a;
}

// Tightly Encapsulated Class? -> NO // because of inherit A
class c extends A
{
  private int no1;
}
```
