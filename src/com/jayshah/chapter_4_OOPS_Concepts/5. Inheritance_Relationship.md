## Inheritance in Java

#### Relationship Between Java Classes :-
- Use of relationship between java classes :-
1. Code Reusability
2. Less Execution Time
3. Less Memory Usage
   
#### Types of relationships :-
1. IS-A Relationship (Inheritance)
   - IS-A relationship is one in which data members of one class is obtained into another class through the concept of inheritance.
   - Types of IS-A relationship :-
     - 1.1 Single Inheritance
     - 1.2 Multilevel Inheritance
     - 1.3 Hierarchical Inheritance
     - 1.4 Multiple Inheritance
     - 1.5 Hybrid Inheritance
     - `Note:` Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical - Inheritance possible for classes
     - `Note:` Multiple, Hybrid - Inheritance not possible in Java but still you want to achieve in Java then use interfaces (but you can not say it's a proper Inheritance).


2. HAS-A Relationship (Association)
   - HAS-A relationship is one in which an object of one class is created as a data member into another class.
   - Types of HAS-A relationship :-
     1. Ont-To-One
     2. One-TO-Many
     3. Many-To-One
     4. Many-To-Many
   - Forms of HAS-A relationship :-
     - 2.1 Aggregation
     - 2.2 Composition


3. USES-A Relationship (Dependence)
   - USES-A relationship is one in which a method of one class is using an object of another class

#### UML Notation in Java :-

#### `check diagram in pdf`

#### Terms used for inheritance :-
1. Class
2. Sub-Class / Child Class
3. Super-Class / Parent Class
4. Reusability
   
#### IS-A Relationship :-
- It is also known as "Inheritance"
- IS-A Relationship or Inheritance is achieved by using "extends" keyword
- All java classes except Object class will always have one parent class thus we can say that the total java API is implemented based on inheritance concept
- `check diagram online: ALL JAVA CLASSES - see images`

#### Use of inheritance :-
1. Code Reusability
2. For Method Overriding to achieve runtime polymorphism
   => Syntax of inheritance :-
   ```
   class Sub-Class extends Super-Class
   {
       // body
   }
   ```

#### Types of Inheritance :-

- Total there are 5 types of inheritance :-
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance
4. Multiple Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance

NOTE: 
       -----
      |  A  |
      |_____| 
        /\    <---- head - (point to) parent i.e. A
        ||
        ||    <---- tail - (point to) child i.e. B
       -----
      |  B  |
      |_____|

```

#### Points to Remember :-
- `Default Parent Class`: By default if any java class does not inherit any parent class then it inherits Object class
- `Parent class can only be one`: There can be only one parent class for every class and due to this java does not support multiple inheritance.
  - i.e.: error (trying to do multiple inheritance) => class B extends A, C {......}
  - i.e.: run => class B extends A {.......}
- Which part is not inherited :-
  1. Private members of parent class is not inherited in child class
  2. Constructors are not inherited because constructors are not the part of class members (class members are only fields, methods, nested classes).
- Cyclic inheritance is not possible
  1. class A extends A
  2. class A extends B { --- }
     class B extends A { --- }
- Multiple and Hybrid inheritance is not possible in case of classes, but it is possible in case of interfaces.

#### Interview Questions :
1. Why java does not support multiple inheritance?
2. How we can achieve Multiple and Hybrid inheritance?
3. Various possible combinations for inheritance?

interface I1
{

}
interface I2
{

}
class B
{

}
class C extends B implements I1, I2
{

}
```

```java

interface I1
{
   void show1();  // abstarct method
   // implementation part is not here
}
interface I2
{
   void show1();  // abstarct method
   // implementation part is not here
}
class B
{

}
class C extends B implements I1, I2
{
   void show() {
      // here we have made implementation part
   }
   // when you call show method 
   // by using C class object that time 
   // it will call its own show() method
   // it does not care if I1 and I2 interfaces
   // have method or not......

}
```
`Note:` 
   - What is the meaning of the Inheritance?
   - extending the properties....we bring the Parent's property in child. 
   - use of inheritance is code reusability.
   - In interface, it does not have any proper full property, it has only half.
   - Because just has method name (known as `abstract method`). Just declaration part not implementation part.
   - So, just for the declaration, code reusability will not be possible.

```java


//
/*
 *          Interface
 * 
 * Interface A -> show();
 * Interface B -> show();
 * Class C => known as implementation/implemented class
 * Why? because it provides the body which does not have in interface.

 2. interface I2 extends interface I1
 3. interface I2 implements interface I1 ==> This is wrong. Not Possible
 4. interface I1 extends class A ==> This is wrong. Not Possible
 5. interface I1 implements class A ==> This is wrong. Not Possible
 6. class C implements interface I1
 7. class C extends interface I1 ==> This is wrong. Not Possible
 8. class C implements interface I1, I2
 9. class C extends class B implements interface I1, I2
 10. class C implements interface I1, I2 extends class B ==> This is wrong. Not Possible
