## Constructors in Java

#### Constructors :-
- WHAT IS CONSTRUCTOR?  
  - Constructors are the special methods having same name as that of class name and does not have any return type
- EXAMPLE :
```
class Animal
{
    Animal()
    {   ...
    }
}
```

- USE OF CONSTRUCTOR: Constructors are used to initialize an object but not for object creation

- WHEN CONSTRUCTORS ARE EXECUTED?: 
  - Constructors are executed exactly at the time of object creation, not before or after object creation
- HOW CONSTRUCTORS ARE EXECUTED?  
  - Constructors are executed automatically when we create an object
- SYNTAX :
```
access-modifiers ClassName(list of parameters) throws Exception1, Exception2, --
{
    //initialization code
}
```
- We can use any access-modifier for the constructor i.e. public, private, protected or default. This is done to control the object creation
- We cannot use abstract, final, static, synchronized etc. keywords with constructors.

- TYPES OF CONSTRUCTORS : There are 3 types of constructors.
  1. Default Constructors (compiler)
  2. 0-Argument Constructors (programmer)
  3. Parametrized Constructors (programmer)
1. Default Constructors :-
   - Whenever we don't create any constructor in class, then compiler will always create a constructor which is known as default constructor.
   - Default constructors are used to provide the default values to the objects like 0, null etc. depending on the type.
   - `Note` : If programmer creates any one constructor then compiler will not generate default constructor
   - Prototype of default constructor :-
   1. Access-modifier of default constructor will be same at that of class access-modifier.
   2. Access-modifier of default constructor cannot be private or protected because outer class can't be private or protected
   3. Default constructor has only one line of code i.e. `super();`

```java
class Test
{
	Test ()
	{
		
	}
}
```
```java
public class Test
{
    public Test ()
    {
        
    }
}
```
```java
class Test
{
	Test ()
	{
		super();
	}
}
```
```java
public class Test
{
    public Test ()
    {
        super();
    }
}
```
2. 0-Argument Constructors :-
   - These constructors are created by the programmer.
```java
class Test
{
	Test ()
	{
		
	}
}
```

3. Parametrized Constructors :-
   - These constructors are created by the programmer
```java
class Test
{
	Test (int a, int b)
	{
		
	}
}

```
```java
// goto terminal and type: first compile javac Animal5 then javap Animal5
// you can see overall things
// also check without creating constructor inside the class.
// you can see default constructor
class Animal5
{
	int age;
	String color;

    /* when you create parameterised constructor
     * that time there is a recommendation
     * to create one the default constructor
     * because it might be possible you do not want initialized the object. 
     * like Animal5 newObj = new Animal5();
     * but, this is not compulsory. This is not rule.
    */ 
    
	Animal5(int age1, String color1) // created by programmer
	{
		age=age1;
		color=color1;
	}

	void eat()
	{
		System.out.println("i am eating");
	}
	void run()
	{
		System.out.println("i am running");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Animal5 buzo=new Animal5(10, "brown");
		System.out.println("Age : "+buzo.age);
		System.out.println("Color : "+buzo.color);
		buzo.eat();
		buzo.run();

		System.out.println("---------------------");

		Animal5 cat=new Animal5(5, "black");
		System.out.println("Age : "+cat.age);
		System.out.println("Color : "+cat.color);
		cat.eat();
		cat.run();
	}
}
```

#### What is difference between Methods & Constructors :-
1. Methods always have return type.
   - Constructors does not have any return type even void.
```java
class ConstructorDemo
{
    ConstructorDemo() // consider as Constructor
    {

    }
}
```
```java
class ConstructorDemo
{
	void ConstructorDemo() // consider as method
	{

	}
}
```
2. Methods can have any valid name.
   - Constructors always have same name as that of class name.
3. Methods are used to perform any particular task.
   - Constructors are always used to initialize an object.
4. We have to call the methods explicitly by using object name or class name.
   - Constructors are called automatically when we create an object.
5. If we don't create any method then compiler will not generate any method.
   - If we don't create any constructor then compiler will generate default constructor.

#### Topics related to constructor :-
1. Constructors with inheritance
2. Constructors overloading and overriding
3. Constructors chaining (using this keyword)
4. Use of super keyword with constructor
5. Constructors with abstract class & interface
6. Constructors with exception handling
7. Copy constructor

#### NOTE :-
   - Constructor is predefined class present in `java.lang.reflect` package
   - This Constructor class is used to get constructor related information
   - check in terminal: 
     - `javap java.lang.reflect.Constructor;`
     - do same thing for class, objects, methods.
   - in constructor, we can write different code but normally we do not write anything. Just do initialized values.
   
   
   ïƒ° Program Flow


```java
class Student
{
	int rollno;
	String name;
 
	Student(int rollno1, String name1) // parameterized constructor
	{
		rollno = rollno1;
		name = name1;
	}
	void show()
	{
		System.out.println("Rollno : "+rollno+" & Name : "+name);
	}
}
class StudentMain
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Student s1=new Student(101, "Govardhan");
		Student s2=new Student(102, "Dwarkesh");
		Student s3=new Student(103, "Girirajji");
	
		s1.show();
		s2.show();
		s3.show();
	}
}
```
