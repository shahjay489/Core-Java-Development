## Association in Java

### HAS-A Relationship (Association) :-
- Association is relation between two separate classes which establishes through their objects
- Association has 4 types :-
  1. One-to-One Association
  2. One-to-Many Association
  3. Many-to-One Association
  4. Many-to-Many Association

- Association has 2 forms :-
  1. Composition (strong bonding)
  2. Aggregation (week bonding)

#### `check diagram in pdf 6.2 for Association`

```
                              Car IS-A Vehicle
          Vehicle             Scooter IS-A Vehicle
         /\     /\ 
    IS-A /       \  IS-A
        /         \
       CAR        SCOOTER          Car HAS-A Engine (Strong Bonding - Composition)
 HAS-A / \ HAS-A                   Car HAS-A Music Player (Week Bonding - Aggregation)
      /   \
   Engine  Music Player

```

#### Difference between Composition & Aggregation :  Interview Question 
1. Real World Example :
   - Composition :- Car HAS-A Engine
   - Aggregation :- Car HAS-A MusicPlayer
2. UML Diagram : - check diagram in pdf 6.2
    - Composition :- Car ------<filled> Engine
   - Aggregation :- Car ------<> MusicPlayer
3. - Composition :- part-of
   - Aggregation :- has
4. Type of bonding :
   - Composition :- Strong Bonding
   - Aggregation :- Week Bonding


#### Note:
- Aggregation (week bonding) - use  Getter and Setter
- Composition (strong bonding) - use Constructor
  - when we declare another class and object is made, at the same time these things have to initialized that's why we are going to use constructor


#### Where we have to use IS-A relation and HAS-A relation
- If we want to inherit all the properties of parent class into child class then we can use IS-A relation but if we want only partial inherit then we have to use HAS-A relation.

### One-to-One Association :-
- Real World Example :-
  1. One person has one passport
  2. One employee has one employee id
  3. One student has one roll no
- It is a relation between entities where one instance of an entity should be mapped only to one instance of another entity

### One-to-Many Association :-
- Real World Example :-
  1. One person can have multiple phone numbers
  2. One student can have multiple courses
  3. One person can have multiple bank accounts
  4. One machine can have multiple functionalities like tea, coffee etc
  5. One customer can have multiple orders
  6. One class can have multiple students
- It is the relation between entity classes where one instance of an entity should be mapped with multiple instance of another entity


#### `check diagram in pdf 6.2`

### Many-to-One Association :-
- Real World Example :-
  1. Many colleges can associate with single university
  2. Multiple cities exist in one state 
  3. Many ports can exist in one extension
  4. Multiple students can have one branch
- It is a relation between entities where multiple instances of an entity should be mapped with exactly one instance of another entity.


### Many-to-Many Association
- Real World Example :-
  1. Multiple customers can buy multiple products and multiple products can be bought by multiple customers
  2. Multiple students can associate with multiple teachers and multiple teachers are associated with multiple students
  3. Multiple students can learn multiple languages
   
- It is relation between entities where multiple instances of an entity should be mapped with multiple instances of another entity.
