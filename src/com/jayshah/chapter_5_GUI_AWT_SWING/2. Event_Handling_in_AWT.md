## Events in AWT

### Event Handling :-
- Changing the state of an object is known as event.
- For example clicking on button, focus on textfield, mouse event on any component etc
- To perform any event java provides an package i.e. java.awt.event

    - NOTE: `check in PDF`


- NOTE : Whenever we have to perform any event on component then we have to register that component for event and for this java provide registration methods

#### Adapter Pattern:
- for example, I have implements all the methods from interface B to class A. But, I want only 2 methods and rest of things I do not need right now. So, I make new class C and those all methods I removed and put in the class C. Now, class A extends class C and implements B. This is called Adapter Pattern. 
- make it example for this to learn in the deep.


#### NOTE:
- I did not write all programs here.
- Also, I have code file in zip folder with mine.
- I did not try to make it by own, because of my priority and lack of time.
- Net Beans, Eclipse are using during video lecture.
- I prefer Intellij.
