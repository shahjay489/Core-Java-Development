## File Handling in Java

### File :
- A file is an object on a computer which stores the data, information, settings, commands etc.
- There are many file operations for example, creating new file, rename file, deleting file, writing into file, reading from the file etc


- There are 2 ways by which we can read data form the file :-
  1. **Sequential Access** :
     - In this way we can read or write the data in sequential form i.e. from beginning or starting of the file.
  
  2. **Random Access** : 
     - In this way we can read or write the data in random way i.e. from any location of the file.



- To perform these operations java provided many classes and methods but main class is "`java.io.File`" class


### Sequential Access
- done in the programs using java.io.File class

### Random Access :
- To read and write the files in random way, we have to use "`java.io.RandomAccessFile`" class.
- There can permissions i.e "r" or "rw".
  - writeXXX(XXX value)
  - readXXX(XXX value)
  - seek(long pos)
