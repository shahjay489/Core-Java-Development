- Runnable is a functional interface and it is present in the `java.lang` package and this `java.lang` package we do not need to import.
- Runnable interface has only ony one abstract `run()` method. (This interface does not have any method)
- Thread class has so many methods and constructors.

### Thread class methods (Part 1) in Java

#### Thread class constructors :-
1. `public Thread() { - }`   : default constructor
2. `public Thread(Runnable target) { - }` : we can provide reference of the Runnable
3. `public Thread(String name) { - }` : when we want to provide thread name directly that time we can use this constructor
4. `public Thread(Runnable target, String name) { - }` : 2nd and 3rd both are in this constructor
5. `public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target) { - }`
6. `public Thread(ThreadGroup group, String name) { - }`
7. `public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name) { - }`
8. `public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name, long stackSize) { - }`

1. Simple methods :-
   - `run()` - this method contains the thread task
   - `start()` - this method is used to create thread
   - `currentThread()` - this method returns the reference of current running thread
   - `isAlive()` - this method is used to check weather the thread is running or not
- `See Programs`:
  - [Test1.java](_4_ThreadClassMethods%2FMultithreadingDemo3%2FTest1.java)

   
2. Naming Methods :-
   - `getName()` - this method is used to get the current running thread name
   - `setName`(String name) - this method is used to set the name of current running thread
- `See Programs`:
    - [Test2.java](_4_ThreadClassMethods%2FMultithreadingDemo3%2FTest2.java)
    - [Test3.java](_4_ThreadClassMethods%2FMultithreadingDemo3%2FTest3.java)

3. Daemon thread methods :
   - `isDaemon()` - this method is used to check weather the thread is daemon thread or not
   - `setDaemon(boolean b)` - this method is used to create daemon thread
- `See Programs`:
    - [Test4.java](_4_ThreadClassMethods%2FMultithreadingDemo3%2FTest4.java)
    - [Test5.java](_4_ThreadClassMethods%2FMultithreadingDemo3%2FTest5.java)
  
#### Daemon Threads :-
- Daemon threads are the threads which are executed in the background of another thread
- For example : `Garbage collector`, `finalizer`, spelling checker in word etc
- Daemon thread is used to provide the service to the other threads
- Daemon thread methods :
   - `isDaemon()`
   - `setDaemon(boolean b)`

### Note :
1. We cannot create the running thread as daemon thread. If we try to create daemon thread after thread has started then it will throw an exception saying "java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException".
2. We cannot create `main thread` as daemon thread because JVM starts the main thread before we create it as daemon thread.
3. Daemon thread life depends on another thread in which it is running.
4. Daemon thread inherits the properties/nature from its parent thread.
5. JVM can stop the daemon thread, but it cannot stop the normal thread.
6. It is recommended to make the lowest priority of daemon thread.
   - because if multiple thread has the same priority then JVM can start any thread that is why we need to set Daemon thread priority law.
7. By default, priority of the main thread is 5, so when you make daemon thread inside the main (method/thread) then its priority is also be 5. Also, we can change the priority of the threads.
8. By default, any thread is the Daemon thread, and we make new thread using that daemon thread then this new thread also be a Daemon thread.
   - because its inherit parents property (point number 4).
