### Multithreading Introduction in Java

#### Multitasking :-
- Performing multiple task at single time
- Examples :
  - When we perform multiple task for example opening vlc, word, notepad, browser etc. on single system
- Multitasking use the concept of `context switching` internally
- `Context Switching:` it runs each task at a time not together, but the time period is like nanosecond, so it looks like all are running together. This concept called context switching, which do switching every task. Multitasking is used to increase the performance of CPU.


- Multitasking can be achieved by 2 ways :-
  1. Process based multitasking (Multiprocessing)
  2. Thread based multitasking (Multithreading)


- Multitasking is used to reduce the ideal time of CPU.

```

#### Multiprocessing :-
- Multiprocessing is the part when one system is connected with multiple processor (CPU).
- Multiprocessing is the best suitable at system level or OS level.


#### Note:
- `Multitasking` & `Multiprocessing` are not program related. 
- For more deeply learn, do study of `Operating System`  
- `Multithreading` is more used at the program level.

#### Multithreading :-
- Multithreading is the part which multiple threads (sub-process) are executed at single time.
- Examples :
  1. Word
  2. VLC
  3. Games
  4. Animations
  5. Browser
  6. Web-servers
  - etc.


- Multithreading is mostly implemented by java itself, we have to implement less part of multithreading.


- Java provides API for multithreading :-
  1. Thread
  2. Runnable
  3. ThreadGroup
  4. Concurrency
  5. ThreadPool
  - etc.

#### What is difference between Process & Thread ?
1. 
   - Process is the heavy-weight task performing multiple tasks
   - Thread is the light-weight sub-process performing single task


2. 
   - Process does not depend on each other
   - Threads depends on each other


3. 
   - Context switching is difficult in process (takes more time)
   - Context switching is easy in threads (takes less time)


4. 
   - Process shares the different address space
   - Threads shares the same address space


5. 
   - Process does not require `Synchronization`
   - Threads requires `Synchronization`


#### How to create Process :
- like creating new project.
- see examples of the Process, all are separate projects
- Process requires proper documentation
- OOPs(Classes, Objects, Methods - these 3 concepts are used in Process)

#### How to create threads :
- Programmer creates threads very carefully.
- Classes, Methods, Interfaces are used in threads.


- There are 2 ways to create threads :-
1. By using "`Thread`" class
2. By using "`Runnable`" interface


1. What is "Thread" :-
   - Thread is the pre-defined class which is present in `java.lang package`
   - it presents in the `java.lang package` so we do not need to import it.
   - Syntax :
     ```java
     class Thread implements Runnable
     {
         // constructors
     
         // methods
         run()
         start()
         - etc.
     }
     ```
2. What is "Runnable" :-
   - Runnable is pre-defined interface present in `java.lang package`
   - Syntax :
      ```java
      interface Runnable
      {
         //method
         run()  // run() is abstract method
      }
   
      ```
   - **in `interface`, all methods are abstract methods.**
   - **`abstract method`: they do not have method implementation.**
     
#### Which is a better way to create thread, Thread or Runnable ?
- Runnable is a better way to create threads in java because if we inherit Thread class then we were not able to inherit any other class as `multiple inheritance` **is not supported in java** but if we inherit Runnable interface then we can inherit more interfaces and can inherit the class also.


```java

interface Runnable
{
   // method
   run()  // run() is abstract method
}

class Thread implements Runnable
{
   // constructors

   // methods
   run()
   start()
   - etc.
}

-----------------------------------------------
Class Thread1 implements Runnable
{
    
}

Class Thread2 exetends Thread
{

}
-----------------------------------------------
// This is possible
class Game exetends JFrame implements Runnable, ActionListener, KeyListener, -, -
{....}

// in this way, you can not inherit other calss 
// which you made for big project and need to have property
// inherit in this class
// because Java is not supported multiple inheritance
class Game exetends Thread implements Runnable, ActionListener, KeyListener, -, -
{....}
```
