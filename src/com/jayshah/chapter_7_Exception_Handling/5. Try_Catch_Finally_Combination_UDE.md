Final, finally and finalize; User Defined Exceptions in Java


### try-catch-finally combinations :-
- Note : We can use either catch or finally or both with try block


- See programs:
  - [TryCatchFinally1.java](_5_Try_Catch_Finally_Combination_UDE%2FtryCatchCombinationProgram%2FTryCatchFinally1.java)

### Interview Question

What is difference between final, finally & finalize ?

- 1. 
  - "final" is the keyword
  - "finally" is the block
  - "finalize" is the method


- 2. 
  - "final" keyword can be used with variable (the value cannot be changed or re-assigned the final variable), method (we cannot override the final method) & class (we cannot inherit the final class)
  - "finally" block is used to close the resources
  - "finalize" is the Object class method which is executed just prior to the garbage collector (or gc() method). It is used to perform the clean-up activity related to the object.
  

```
    
      Garbage Collector
        /------\
       /  GC()  \
       \ method /
        \------/ \
                  \ finalize()         Object
                   \              /---------------\
                    \----------> /   different     \
                                 \   functionality /
                         /---->   \---------------/
          b ------------/                        
      variable
              
              - Any reference variable is not pointing this object
              - that means now this object is a waste         
              - because to use object functionality we use some variable whic point to object (here b) 
              - So at the last, excecute all functionality of the object (using finalize() method) and then GC() method clean it (delete that object)...       
                                  
                                  
      Example: 
      
      Connection con = -------;
      ----
      ----
      con = null;
                                       
```


### User Defined Exceptions :-
- User defined exceptions can be Checked or Unchecked exceptions.
- While we create an API we normally create Checked Exceptions.
- When we want to create normal exception then we can use Runtime Exceptions.
- To create Checked Exception we have to use "Exception" class
- To create Unchecked Exceptions we have to use "RuntimeException" class


#### Steps to create User Defined Exceptions :-
1. Create a user defined exception class and inherit Exception or RuntimeException class.
2. Create a parametrized constructor.
3. "throw" the exception and handle it.
