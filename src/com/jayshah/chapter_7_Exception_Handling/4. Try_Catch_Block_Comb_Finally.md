### “finally” block in Java

#### finally block :-
- finally is the block which is always executes after try or catch block
- finally block contains `resource closing code` for example database connection, reading or writing from file etc.


- Note:
  - The finally block always execute (after try-catch block) whether exception occurs or not. (even if exception occurs then also finally block execute after catch block)

- syntax:
   ```java
   try {
       // write risky code in try block
   } catch {
       // write maintainance/handling code in catch block
   }
   finally {
       // always execute after try-catch block.
   }
   ```

   ```
         Java Applicaiton                 abc.txt 
         +---------------+   read file     ________
         |               | <-----------   |        |
         |               |  ----------->  |________|
         +---------------+   write file        
         
                                 /\
                                 ||
                               resources
                               
                - after complete the work need to finish the resources
                - so in finaaly block we can write those things.    
                
                - if we do not close and this cycle do 1000 times then?
                - 1000 resources created and those are open 
                - then our application getting slow.             
   ```
   ```

### Java 7 Updates for Exception Handling :-
1. `Multi-catch block` :
- Before Java 7 version, we can catch only one exception type in each catch block. So whenever we needed to handle more than one specific exception, but take same action for all exceptions, then we had to have more than one catch block containing the same code.
- But from Java 7.0 version, it is possible for a single catch block to catch multiple exceptions by separating each with | (pipe symbol) in catch block.
- Syntax :
   `Catch(Exception1 | Exception2 | - | e) {body}`
- see programs:
  - [MultiCatchBlock1.java](_4_Try_Catch_Block_Comb_Finally%2FMultiCatchBlock1.java)


2. try with resource :-
- try with resource is used to automatically close the resources that the programmer has created.
- try with resource can contain only that class which inherits AutoCloseable interface.
- Due to "try with resource", the importance of "finally" block has decreased.


- Note:
  - here in try(.....) we can provide only those class/resource which inherit `AutoClosable interface`. 


- Syntax :
  ```java
  try(Resourse1; Resourse2; -; -) { 
     // body 
  }
  catch(ExceptionClassName e) { 
     // body 
  }
  ```
