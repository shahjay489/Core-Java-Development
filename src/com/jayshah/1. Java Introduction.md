1. Programming Language

- Java is a high level object oriented programming language, whose syntax has been driven from C/C++.
- Platform : Java is a platform because java has its own runtime environment (JRE)
- Editions: 
  - J2SE: 
    - Java 2 Standard Edition (Core Java)
    - Core Java Fundamentals
    - Projects: Standalone Desktop Applications
    - Whatever projects built by using J2SE those are high level - so you can have deep understanding, strong and clear concepts, demand is very low but in way of fundamentals, it is very high.
    - Standalone: single machine project
    
  - J2EE: Java 2 Enterprise Edition (Advance Java) 
    - Server Side programming (multiple machine can execute ) 
    - Projects: Enterprise Application

  - J2ME: Java 2 Micro Edition (It has been replaced by Android)
    - Micro programming
    - Projects: Mobile based applications


2. History
   - Which Company made?: Sun Microsystems (before)
   - Present Owner: Oracle
   - Designed by: James Gosling & his team
   - Reason: 
     - easy, 
     - simple (not like C/C++ - pointers, multiple inheritance, a lot of coding require), 
     - platform independent (not like C/C++ - platform dependent),
     - tight coded programming languages (number of lines are less in coding)
     - performance more - cost less 
     - less costing compare to other
     - maintenance less
   - Name: Oak (Java)
   - Year : development -> 1991 : release -> 1995

4. What is difference between C, C++ & Java?
    1. Programming PARADIGM:
        - C: Procedural Language 
        - C++: OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
        - Java: Pure OOP (Object Oriented Programming) - 99%
    2. Origin:
       - C: Based on Assembly Language
       - C++: Based on C Language
       - Java: Based on C & C++
    3. Designed By/Year:
       - C: Dennis Ritchie / 1972
       - C++: Bjarne Stroustrup / 1979
       - Java: James Gosling / 1995
    4. Translator:
       - C: Compiler
       - C++: Compiler
       - Java: Interpreter & Compiler
    5. File Generated
       - C: .exe file
       - C++: .exe file
       - Java: .class file
    6. Static/Dynamic Programming Language:
       - Static Programming: If Primitive Data Type allocate memory at compile time. 
         - e.g. : C, C++ 
       - Dynamic Programming: If Primitive Data Type allocate memory at run time
         - e.g. : Java
    7. Pre-Processor Directives:
        - C, C++ : Support Header Files (#include, #define)
        - Java: Use Packages (import)
        - Note: in C, C++ pre-processor is required whereas in Java it is not.
    8. Platform Dependent/Independent
       - C: Platform Dependent
       - C++: Platform Dependent
       - Java: Platform Independent
    9. Pointers
       - C: Support Pointers
       - C++: Support Pointers
       - Java: Does Not Support Pointers
    10. Inheritance (single/multiple/multilevel/hierarchical/hybrid)
      - C: No inheritance concept
      - C++: Support inheritance (all type)
      - Java: Support inheritance but not multiple inheritance (Also, multiple through hybrid inheritance)
    11. Overloading
       - C: Does not support
       - C++: Support (function overloading and operator  - overloading)
       - Java: Support (not operator overloading only method overloading)
       - **Note:** Function terminology is used in C,C++. In Java, it is called method.
    12. Destructors
       - C: does not support constructor and destructor
       - C++: supports destructor
       - Java: does not support destructor but Java has constructor
       - **Note:** Java has garbage collector which automatically delete waste objects. So memory management is good in Java. 
    13. Call by Value/ Call by Reference
        - C: support both
        - C++: support both 
        - Java: support only Call by Value
        

#### Interview Questions:
1. What is static or dynamic language? 
2. How Java is dynamic programming language?
3. Why Java does not require Pre-Processor? => (use packages not header files)
4. How Java is platform independent? 
5. Why Java does not support pointers? 
   - pointers only come when static memory allocation concept come but Java is dynamic programming language
   - Java is platform independent language 
```
windows 
 ________________________________________________
|
| int 1=10;  => allocate memory |__| 
|             => address of that memory is for example 1001
|
| int*p;    => pointer allocation
|
| p=&a;     => now in p, it stores address 1001, 
|           => that address has value 10
|_________________________________________________

now compile above program and let's take it to Linux

Linux
 _______________________________________________________________
| it might be possible, on this machine something else also working and at the same time it has different/something value store at that address (1001)
|
| now C, C++ is a platform dependent so, it always provides right output but Java is a platform independent and here it has problem

6. How Java is dynamic programming language? 
7. Why Java does not support multiple inheritance? 
8. Why Java has good memory management as compared to C & C++?
9. import vs #include? 
   - #include: only one header file load; 
   - import: load more than one class file 
10. What is call by reference and call by value?
    - when we call function at that time we provide address or variable's location(means location of variable), known as call by reference
    -  when we call function at that time we provide value of the variable, know as call by value
    - **Note:** Call by reference only and only possible if we have pointer's concept
10. Why Java has good memory management as compared to C & C++? 
    - Java has one component known as Garbage Collector and Java is dynamic programming language so (primitive data type variable) it will allocate memory at run time.
