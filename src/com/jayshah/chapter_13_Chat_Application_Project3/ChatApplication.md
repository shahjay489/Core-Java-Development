4. copy dist folder. (this folder is created after doing 1st step clean and build)
5. paste some where else and change name according to client or sever
6. do this process for both client and server
7. you can run this 2 files (inside the folders) in different jvm
8. now go in this folder and run file.

    - right click on the file and extract .jar file
    - then you can see new folder created (name is project name)
    - do edit `MENIFEST.ME` file with notepad
