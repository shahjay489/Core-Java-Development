Java/Python Introduction

1. What is difference between Java & Python ?
   1. Programming Paradigm
      - Java : Pure OOP (Object Oriented Programming) 
      - From Java SE 8 version, Java introduced some procedural oriented programming paradigm features like Lambda Expression, functional interface, Functions, Predicates, Module System (Java 9))
      - Python : Procedural Oriented and OOP both
        
   2. Statically or Dynamically Typed Language
      - Java : Statically Typed Programming Language 
        - example: 
          - int rollno = 01; 
          - String name="Govardhan";
      - Python : Dynamically Typed Programming Language 
        - example 
          - rollno = 01
          - name="Govardhan"
          
3. Compilative or Interpretive language
   - Java : It is both compilative and interpretive programming language
   - Python : It is interpretive programming language (no need to compile - it can be executed directly)
   
4. Translator
    - Java : It has compiler and interpreter
    - Python : It has only interpreter
```java
JAVA
Demo.java
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Govardhannathji);
        System.out.println("Dwarkadhish);    
    }
}

=> for compile use - use compiler
=> for execution run time - use interpreter
        
=> Go to turminal run this program by using below commands:
javac Demo.java 
java Demo
        
Note: javac Demo.java - this will create .class file -> Demo.class  : it calls compile the program)

=> Output:
Govardhannathji
Dwarkadhish


```

```python
PYTHON
DemoPython.py
print("Govardhan - Dwarkesh")

=> Go to turminal and run this program by using below commands:
python DemoPython.py

=> Output:
Govardhan - Dwarkesh
```

5. Speed
   - Java : It is faster as compared to python
   - Python : It is slower as compared to java
   
6. Portability
   - Java : As java supports more hardware 
     - example computers, mobiles, remotes, tv etc thus java is more portable
   - Python : It is less portable as compared to java
   
7. Inheritance
   - Java : It supports except multiple inheritance
   - Python : It supports all inheritances
8. Use of ";"
   - Java : It is mandatory to use ; in java
   - Python : It is not mandatory to use ; in python
9. Use of {}
   - Java : Its mandatory to use {} in java
   - Python : {} are not used in python (python used indentation)
   - **Note:** means it uses spaces 
10. Syntax
    - Java : Hard Coded (if you miss any ; or {} then it will provide an error)
    - Python : Easy Syntax (easy to remember as it is close to humans)
11. Length of Code
    - Java : Java has more number of lines of code
    - Python : Python has less number of lines of code
12. Database Compatibility
    - Java : It has more compatibility with database as compared to python. 
      - One big & very famous library which connects Java to database is JDBC - Java Database Connectivity.
    - Python : It is less compatible with database and due to this reason python is rarely used in distributed (enterprise) applications.
13. Frameworks
    - Java : Java provides more frameworks for example Spring, Hibernate, JSF, Struts.
    - Python : Python provides less framework as compared to java for example Django, Flask.
14. Machine Learning Libraries
    - Java : Weka, Mallet, Deeplearning4j, MOA
    - Python : Tensorflow, PyTorch
15. Best for which area
    - Java : Java is best for Desktop GUI Applications, Enterprise/distributed Applications, Mobile Applications, Embedded Systems
    - Python : Python is best for Scientific & Numeric Computing, Machine Learning, AI

### Java Features
1. Simple
   - Java is using all the simplified syntax from C & C++
   - Some C & C++ features were either removed (pointers, multiple inheritance) from java or was created automatic (memory management)
   - Java has less execution time period and less maintenance (less memory, less power)
2. PlatForm Independent:-
   - Java is a platform independent language which means java can be executed on any machine or operating system
   - means compile on any one machine / operating system and run on any other / operating system
```
 windows  : make program and compile that program
 ________________________________________
| windows JVM                            |
|                                        |
| Demo.java     |  Demo.class            |
| Class Tes {   |  GHJVGJ?"B<VP:LGNH":   |
|  .......      |  KG??:>$#$%!%CTY^%!&@  | 
| }             |  (*&H^&H&J)            |
|________________________________________|


 Different OS : run program by using that compile file and see the same output 
 _____________________________________________
|Linux  JVM     | MAC  JVM     | Windows JVM  |
|               |              |              |
|Demo.class run |Demo.class run|Demo.class run|
| Govardhan     | Govardhan    | Govardhan    |
| Dwarkesh      | Dwarkesh     | Dwarkesh     |

```

3. Portable
   - Java is portable language as it can be executed on multiple hardware
4. OOP (Object Oriented Programming):-
   - Java is OOP language thus java works around objects
   - Java supports many OOP features like classes, objects and methods, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation etc.
5. Security
   - Java is very secured language because
     1. Java does not have pointers
     2. Java has byte code verifier
     3. Java has a security manager that defines the access for java classes
6. Robust
   - Java is Robust i.e. powerful language because
     1. Java provides a lot of classes and interfaces to handle the exceptions
     2. Automatic Memory Management
7. Multithreaded Language
   - Java supports multithreading 
8. High Performance
   - Java has high performance because
     1. Robust
     2. Portable
     3. Multithreaded Language
9. Distributed Applications
   - Java can be used for distributed application (enterprise applications - which supports client and server architecture application)
10. Java is compilative and interpretive language

### Interview Questions:-
1. What do you mean by Platform Independent ?
2. How java is Platform Independent ? 
3. Is JVM Platform Dependent or Platform Independent ?
   - Java is Platform Independent
   - JVM is Platform Dependent
